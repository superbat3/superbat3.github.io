        Rock is probably my most preferred music genre. If a song has a nice sounding electric guitar in the background, odds are high on me liking the song. I learned how to play some beginner level guitar in highschool, and was kinda shocked/disappointed that Sac State had no guitar classes open the last time I checked. My older sister bought me a guitar for christmas years ago. Getting this guitar led to me later on using my experience playing guitars for my senior project in high school. I unfortunately have gotten pretty rusty at it nowadays.
